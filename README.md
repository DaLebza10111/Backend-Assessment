<h1 center>Sviluppatore: Laravel Background Job Runner</h1>

<p>This project creates a unique Laravel background task runner that doesn't rely on the integrated queue system. Delay execution, priority handling, logging, retry attempts, and a web-based job management dashboard are all supported by the system.</p>

# Features:

- Custom Job Execution: Run PHP classes and methods as background jobs.
- Job Delays: Delay job execution by a specified number of seconds.
- Job Priority: Higher-priority jobs execute before lower-priority ones.
- Logging: Tracks job execution, status (success/failure), and errors.
- Retry Mechanism: Configurable retry attempts for failed jobs.
- Web Dashboard: View active jobs, logs, and cancel running jobs.
